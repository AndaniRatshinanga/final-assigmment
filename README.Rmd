## Hello Octocat
I love Octocat. She's the coolest cat in town.

```{r, quick look, echo=TRUE }
dim(anscombe)
names(anscombe)
head(anscombe, n=6)
tail(anscombe, n=6)
summary(anscombe)

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## GitHub Documents

This is an R Markdown format used for publishing markdown documents to GitHub. When you click the **Knit** button all R code chunks are run and a markdown file (.md) suitable for publishing to GitHub is generated.

## Including Code

You can include R code in the document as follows:

```{r r xy plot, echo=FALSE, fig.height=8, fig.width=8, fig.align='center', fig.path='./figures/', fig.ext='svg'}
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(tidyr)
data("anscombe")
plot(x=anscombe$x1, y=anscombe$y1)
abline(lm(y1 ~ x1, data = anscombe))

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r data_import, echo=TRUE}
library(readr)

df <- file.path('analgesic.csv')
df <- data.frame('analgesic.csv')
df <- read.csv('analgesic.csv')

```

```{r data_summary, echo=TRUE}
library(readr)

dim(df)
names(df)
head(df, n=6)
tail(df, n=6)
summary(df)

```

```{r data_tidy, echo=TRUE}
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)


df_1 <- gather(df, key = Key, value = Value, Measurement_1, Measurement_2, Measurement_3, -ID)
df_2 <- group_by(df_1)
df_2

summarise(df_2, mean = mean(Value))



```
#chunk 1
## Null hypothesis
 * HO: The chicks weights is dependent on the feed
## Alternative hypothesis 
* H1: the chicks weight is not dependent on the feed
```{r tidy_data, echo=TRUE}
# read chick weight
x<-read.csv("chick-weights.csv")
# tidy the data
boxplot(x$weight~x$feed)

# state statistical test
chickanova <-aov(weight~feed, data = x)
summary(chickanova)

#underlying assumption
"compares means or samples of more than 3 groups"
# degrees of freedom and p value
df = 5
"p-value < 0.05"
"accept null hypothesis"

```
 # chunk 2
 #hypothesis
 ## Null hypothesis
 * Drinking contaminated water does not cause gastroenteritis
 ## Alternative hypothesis
 * drinking contaminated water does cause gastroenteritis
```{r the hotzone, echo=TRUE}
library(knitr)
# read outbreak of severe gastroenteritis
x <- read.csv("gastroenteritis (1).csv")
y <- xtabs(~Consumption + Outcome, data = x)
y
barplot(y, beside = TRUE, ylab = "water consumption", xlab = "clinical presentation",main = "Investigation of gastroenteritis outbreak", col = c("blue", "green", "yellow"))
legend("top", c("<1 glasses/day", ">4 glasses/day", "1 to 4 glasses/day"), fill = c("blue", "green", "yellow"))
# statistical test
Z <- chisq.test(y, correct = TRUE)
Z

```

##Underlying assumptions
* two categorical variables from a single population
* used to determine whether there is an association between 2 variable names 
## interpretation of outcomes
* p< 0.05, therefor reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis

chunk 3
## Null hypothesis
* Recieving chemotherapy does not cause nausea
## Alternative hypothesis
* Recieving chemotherapy does cause nausea
```{r Nausea, echo=TRUE}
# read the intensity of nausea
A <- read.csv("nausea.csv")

#tidy data
# rating scale is anchored at 0(no nausea) to 6(severe nausea and vomiting) therefore change row 8 coloumn 3.
A[8,3] = 4
A
# plotting of data
plot(A$Nausea_before~A$Patient, type = "l", ylim = c(0,6), xlab = "Patients", ylab = "nausea score", main = "The intensity of nausea before and after receiving a 5ht3-receptor blocker")
lines(A$Nausea_after~A$Patient, col= "blue")
legend ("top", c("Nausea_before", "Nausea_after"),fill = c("black", "blue"))

# statistical test
wilcox.test(A$Nausea_before,A$Nausea_after, paired = TRUE)


```

## Test assumption
* The data is paired and non-parametric
* two measurements were taken from the same sample group. 
* P< 0.05 Therefore reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
